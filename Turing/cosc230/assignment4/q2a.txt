Searching for an item takes at most the height of the tree (root starts at 0). So the complexity is at most H.

Big O notation:

	O(H)

	where H is the height of the tree, counted from root = 0.


Alternatively, using n where n is the number of nodes:

	The height of a balanced search tree is log(n), thus:

	O(log(n))
