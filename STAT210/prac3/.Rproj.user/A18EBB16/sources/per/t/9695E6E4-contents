## My response:
## Looks like a negative correlation between skin and conc, meaning, the higher the
## concentration of vaccine, the lower the skin response.
## Their response:
## Figure1 suggests that neither a linear nor a quadratic model would be appropriate
## to describe the relationship between skin response and vaccine concentration
## Also note that, with only 6 ditinct values for the predicotr, the maximum degree
## that can be fitted is a fifth degree polynomial (6-1=5).

# Create dataframe
rat.df <- data.frame(conc,skin)

mod.3 <- lm(skin~conc + I(conc^2) + I(conc^3))
anova(mod.3)
## We'll continue to add our terms until a non-significant result is obtained
mod.4 <- update(mod.3, .~. + I(conc^4))
anova(mod.4)
## After adding the conc^4 we still have a significant p-value of 0.00382
mod.5 <- update(mod.4, .~. + I(conc^5))
anova(mod.5)
## Now after adding conc^5 we have a non-significant term (p-value of beta5 = 0.37)
## It's important to check the confidence intervals as well. There's a coefficients 
## command which shows CI as well.
## Now we check the diagnostics for the 4th degree polynomial regression model.

# Setting the plot dimensions
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(mod.4, which=1:2, add.smooth=FALSE)
## Checking the residuals plots do not indicate a problem with any of the model 
## assumptions. Residuals vs fitted shows a random scatter around 0 (appart from 
## observation 8), the QQ plot is approximately linear, suggesting that the assumption
## of normality is valid. The final model is given by:
## skin = 11.79 + 7.08conc - 7.20conc^2 + 2.73conc^3 -0.35conc^4

## We can plot this model using the following ggplot command
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=rat.df, aes(x=conc, y=skin)) + geom_point(pch=17, color="blue", size=2)+
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 4), color="red", linetype=2)+
    labs(title="4th degree polynomial with 95% confidence bands", x="concentration(ml/L)",
        y="skin (mm)")
## Looking at this model we see that the maximum skin response of between 14-14.2mm is
## predicted to occur at a concentration of approx. 0.8ml/L and a minimum skin response
## of between 13.3-13.5mm at 2ml/L
